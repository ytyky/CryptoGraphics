After exploring multiple websites that provide crypto market data, we developed a few questions that are hard to answer directly through any single sources: 1.The correlation between major cryptocurrencies, are they moved upward or downward together? 2.how to visualize “hotness” of a cryptocurrency? 3.is there any common or different trends between cryptocurrencies? Can we classfy cryptos by their financial properties? In order to answer these questions, we collected crypto market data from different sources, processed, aggregated and visualized them using proper tools. We explored and developed few interests insights based on graphs "],["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Contribution 2.2 Data Collection 2.3 Dataset Information 2.4 Issue", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Contribution Tianyu is responsible to determine the cryptocurencies we are focus on. Juntian downloads corresponding cryptocurrencies’ datasets and determines the scale of the data. 2.2 Data Collection We use coinmarketcap api to verified top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and then pulled each cryptocurrency dataset from coingecko, including historical trading information. We then explore multiple financial sources and yahoo finance is the most tangible and flexible website to download dataset we desired. It not only offers detailed information about the crypto we are interested in, but also provides options to download dataset with self-define time frame. 2.3 Dataset Information We downloaded 5 datasets and each corresponding to one of the major cryptocurrencies we observed above. Each dataset include 7 columns and up to 3292 rows. 2.3.1 Format The format of each dataset: date price market_cap total_volume record 2.3.2 Column Details date: date of the crypto record price: trading price (USD) market_cap: total market cap total_volume: the number of shares traded 2.4 Issue As the histogram above shown, the market cap of Bitcoin is way bigger than any cryptocurrencies. This is a challenging problem because it would affect our comparison between cryptos.

Then we calculate the 15 days volatility of each crypto by calculating the stand deviation of 15 days return, and multiply square root of 365. (For stocks, the volatility is stand deviation multiply square root of 250, but the cryptocurrency can be traded every day, so we choose square root of 365 ) 3.4 Combine All the Value into One table Finally, we combine the volatility, return, and market capitalization and volume with the df.close1, creating the final table df.crpyto ## cryptocurrency price Date market_cap return volatility ## 1 BTC 54810.61 2021-04-29 1.024626e+12 NA NA ## 2 BTC 53596.70 2021-04-30 1.001974e+12 -0.0221473496 NA ## 3 BTC 57828.51 2021-05-01 1.082722e+12 0.0789564931 NA ## 4 BTC 57812.97 2021-05-02 1.080898e+12 -0.0002687715 NA ## 5 BTC 56600.75 2021-05-03 1.057850e+12 -0.0209680266 NA ## 6 BTC 57200.30 2021-05-04 1.069571e+12 0.0105927052 NA ## volume year month ## 1 48072930663 2021 04 ## 2 46958036373 2021 04 ## 3 53879045974 2021 05 ## 4 43967070046 2021 05 ## 5 39072664394 2021 05 ## 6 54132470274 2021 05 "],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values", " Chapter 4 Missing values Observed that volatility and return contains missing values.

"],["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overview 5.2 Correlation 5.3 How hot is the market? 5.4 Dive into Stable Coin 5.5 Crypto as an Investment", " Chapter 5 Results 5.1 Overview The price trend of top 5 cryptos are drawed below. As addressed before, the price of different cryptocurriencies vary a lot and hence we plot them separately by facet We can obtain a general idea of the trend over a year. the price of BTC, ETH and BNB are high at end of April last year, then it bounce up and down, and for the last 4 months (start from 2022) they have a decreasing trend. USDC and USDT have price around 1 dollar since they are stable coin. By nature stable coin are expected to have same value as fiat currency it targets to. From the line plot above we saw that the price range of USDC and USDT is centered around 1 (USD), but still have volatility. We then examine the data range by boxplot, by facet Observed that the Bitcoin is undoubtly a giant in the current market. ETH and BNB are also expensive. The median price per ETH past year is around 3000. The median price per BNB past year is around 400. The rest two kinds of coin, USDC and USDT are waving around 1 dollar, and this is due to the fact that they are “stable coin” that linked to US dollar. The range of USDC and USDT are related small compared to other top cryptos, but they have do a lot of outliers in themselves. 5.2 Correlation We are also interested in the correlation between each cryptocurrency, hence we draw a correlation map to visulize the relationship Observed that the top cryptos in the market can divided into 2 groups. BTC, BNB and ETH have strong positive correlation, their price in general go up and down together. USDC and USDT have weak positive correlation, since they have target price at 1 USD. 5.3 How hot is the market? The crypto market move fast with uncertainty, and we tried to compare the trading volatility over all cryptos past year Observed that all top cryptos are decresing volatility through time. This means that the market is becoming stable and rational. Noticed that BNB has the highest volatility at the begining of our records. This is a relatively new cryptocurrency compared with BTC and ETH. We sepeculate that people are passion about new crypto when it first published. The stable coin USDC, USDT are more stable than last year and thus they probably become mature financial product (since they are suppose to fix their price to 1 usd). Then we plot a scatter plot between volatility and market_cap, facet by different cryptocurrenies. The volatility is high when marketcap is high for all cryptos. This means price is extremely unstable when marketcap is high. Another indicator of the crypto market is cooling down is that the dot plot between date and volume. We see a decreasing trend in trading volume of BTC, ETH and BNB over a year. This implies that less amount of coins are trading in the market. The other group of our interests, USDC and USDT, have continuous trading volumes, indicate that people treat these two type of coins as a tool to exchange their fiat currency in and out of the blockchian industry for varied purposes. The trading market is cooling down but people joined in the crypto industry did not simply leave. 5.4 Dive into Stable Coin The volume of USDC are smaller than USDT during the one year window we observed. They are similar tools that link to US dollar but it seems like USDT is popular than USDC. This might due to the fact that USDT launched eariler than USDC. USDT has a suspicious volume spick in November 2021, after browsing news and external information (other market data source) we suspect this is an error record. We can stack two stable coins’ market cap together to get a general sense of how many US dollar go virtual – around 150 billion USD are now converted to stable coins. A 100% increase in amount of dollors are now tokens on the blockchain. 5.5 Crypto as an Investment The top 3 cryptocurrencies (in market cap), BTC, BNB and ETH are mostly trading as a financial products instead of currencies. People invest in cryptos and expect returns in it. We can visualize the monthly returns of these cryptos to have a sense about what it looks like The monthly return are similar. From the graph we observed that the return rate vary a lot, so investing in crypto might be risky "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component "],["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion After series of analysis on top cryptocurrencies, we know that the trading market of cryptos are cooling down compare with last year. We identified there are mainly 2 groups of cryptos, one group is stable coins linked to fiat currencies and they have less volatility and price per coin is close to 1 unit of the currency they linked to. Another group is those famous cryptos that does not rely on real money, and they have high volatility. Although we observed a decreasing trend in price and returns from top 3 cryptos, we find volume of 2 stable coins increase drastically, indicating the crypto world is still expanding.
