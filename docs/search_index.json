After exploring multiple websites that provide crypto market data, we developed a few questions that are hard to answer directly through any single sources: 1.The correlation between major cryptocurrencies, are they moved upward or downward together? 2.how to visualize “hotness” of a cryptocurrency? 3.market cap of major cryptocurrencies, compare with each other and figure out the relationships between volatility and the market cap.

Juntian downloads corresponding cryptocurrencies’ datasets and determines the scale of the data. 2.2 Data Collection We use coinmarketcap api to verified top 5 cryptocurrencies by market cap, and then pulled each cryptocurrency dataset from yahoo finance, including 1 year long trading information (2021 May - 2022 May). We then explore multiple financial sources and yahoo finance is the most tangible and flexible website to download dataset we desired. It not only offers detailed information about the crypto we are interested in, but also provides options to download dataset with self-define time frame. 2.3 Dataset Information We downloaded 5 datasets and each corresponding to one of the major cryptocurrencies we observed above. Each dataset include 366 rows and 7 columns. 2.3.1 Format The format of each dataset: Date Open High Low Close Adj.Close Volume record 2.3.2 Column Details Date: date of the crypto record Open: open price High: highest price Close: close price Adj.Close: close price after adjustment Volume: the number of shares traded (all price are in USD) 2.4 Issue As the histogram above shown, the market cap of Bitcoin is way bigger than any cryptocurrencies. This is a challenging problem because it would affect our comparison between cryptos.
