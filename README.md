Project Proposal

Cryptocurrency market is trending and we are interested in comparing and contrasting different types of cryptocurrencies, providing insights in the field. After exploring multiple websites that provide crypto market data, we developed a few questions that are hard to answer directly through any single sources:

1.The correlation between major cryptocurrencies, are they moved upward or downward together?

2.how “hot” is a cryptocurrency, by trading frequency, volume, etc

3.how big the crypto market is, i.e, market cap of major cryptocurrencies, compare with each other and figure out the relationships between volatility and the market cap.
Data Sources: 

Yahoo Finance https://finance.yahoo.com/cryptocurrencies/ 

Coinbase https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2

CoinmarketCap https://coinmarketcap.com

To answer the question we made, we plan to collect and integrate the closing price, volume and market cap of different cryptocurrencies in the past one years, then calculate the related value and make several graphs based on these data.
Additionally, the market data from those financial websites only provide graphics for one type of crypto per page. We are planning to provide multiple interactive charts that can visualize the data from different cryptocurrencies, different sources, by users’ preferences. This will address our questions and unveil more information and relationship between different types of cryptos.
